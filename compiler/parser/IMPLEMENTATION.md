# VibeLang Parser Implementation

Implementation status: 📋 Planned

## Roadmap

- [ ] AST node definitions
- [ ] Recursive descent parser
- [ ] Expression parsing with operator precedence
- [ ] Type annotation parsing
- [ ] Contract clause parsing
- [ ] Pattern matching parsing
- [ ] Error recovery
- [ ] Unit tests

## Implementation Notes

The parser will be implemented in Python, following the design outlined in the README.md.

Key features:
- Recursive descent parsing for clarity
- Operator precedence climbing for expressions
- AST node types for all language constructs
- Comprehensive error messages
